Joint project for the courses: <br>
«Algorithms for Massive Datasets»<br>
«Statistical methods for Machine Learning»<br>

This work aims to analyze the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018">«Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009 - 2018» </a> dataset.
Specifically, the task is to implement from scratch a classifier based on logistic regression and to train it to predict whether or not a flight will be canceled, only on the basis of information available at flight departure.
